Towards Trustworthy AI: Blockchain-based Architecture Design for Accountability and Fairness of Federated Learning Systems, https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=ko&user=TuL21poAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=TuL21poAAAAJ:koF6b02d8EEC

However, federated learning systems struggle to achieve and embody responsible AI principles. In particular, federated learning systems face accountability and fairness challenges due to multi-stakeholder involvement and heterogeneity in client data distribution. To enhance the accountability and fairness of federated learning systems, we present a blockchain-based trustworthy federated learning architecture.
