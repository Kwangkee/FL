## Biased Client Selection
Towards Understanding Biased Client Selection in Federated Learning, https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=ko&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Towards+Understanding+Biased+Client+Selection+in+Federated+Learning&btnG=  

In our work, we present the convergence analysis of federated learning with biased client selection and quantify how the bias affects convergence speed. **We show that biasing client selection towards clients with higher local loss yields faster error convergence.** From this insight, we propose Power-of-Choice, a communication- and computation-efficient client selection framework that flexibly spans the trade-off between convergence speed and solution bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Power-of-Choice can converge up to 3Ã— faster and give 10% higher test accuracy than the baseline random selection.
