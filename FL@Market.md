  >- FL-Incentivizer **commercializes and tokenizes the global model** using FL-NFT (FL Non-Fungible Token) based on the ERC-721 standard. 
  >We provide implementation and deployment details, complete smart contract codes, and qualitative evaluation of the FL-Incentivizer. After implementing FL-Incentivizer for a global iteration of a Federated learning task, we showed the FL-NFT on OpenSea and an FL-Token for a learner on MetaMask. FL-NFTs can be traded on markets such as OpenSea like other NFTs. While FL-Tokens can be transferred in the same manner as other ERC-20-based tokens.

- In this research, we propose an open platform “Indy528” and utilize **NFT tokens to represent federated machine learning (FML) models**. 
>- Currently, NFTs are used to tokenise objects such as arts, collectables, and even real estate. In this research, we propose an open platform “Indy528” and utilize NFT tokens to represent federated machine learning (FML) models.

- As a use-case of Indy528, we propose a concept of the NFT-based decentralized FML model marketplace. 
>- Model creators can train the FML models and publish them in the marketplace as NFTs. 
>- Parties who want to use the models can buy them from the model creators as NFTs. The buyers can view model information, accuracy, training process etc via the model card objects stored with the NFT.

In this paper, we present CrowdFL, a platform to facilitate the crowdsourcing of FL model training. It coordinates client selection, model training, and reputation management, which are essential steps for the FL crowdsourcing operations. By implementing model training on actual mobile devices, we demonstrate that the platform improves model performance and training efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first platform to support crowdsourcing-based FL on edge devices.
