## FLAIR
FLAIR: Federated Learning Annotated Image Repository, https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08869
Dataset access and the code for the benchmark are available at https://github.com/apple/ml-flair 

FLAIR is a large dataset of images that captures a number of characteristics encountered in federated learning and privacy-preserving ML tasks. This dataset comprises approximately 430,000 images from 51,000 Flickr users, which will better reflect federated learning problems arising in practice, and it is being released to aid research in the field.
