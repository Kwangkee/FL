- However, standardized evaluation and systematical analysis of diverse pFL methods remain a challenge. 
- To tackle these challenges, we propose the first comprehensive pFL benchmark, pFL-Bench, for facilitating rapid, reproducible, standardized and thorough pFL evaluation. The proposed benchmark contains more than 10 dataset variants in various application domains with a unified data partition and realistic heterogeneous settings; a modularized and easy-to-extend pFL codebase with more than 20 competitive pFL method implementations; and systematic evaluations under containerized environments in terms of generalization, fairness, system overhead, and convergence. 
- The code is released at https://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope/tree/master/benchmark/pFL-Bench
