Federated Learning emerged as a distributed learning paradigm that takes into account several practical challenges, and differentiates itself from traditional distributed learning settings, as noted by Google [20], by addressing four main themes: 
- statistical heterogeneity of data across nodes, 
- data imbalance across nodes, 
- limited communication in the distributed network (e.g., loss of synchronization, variability of communication capabilities), 
- and the possibility of a large number of nodes relative to the amounts of data.

All experiments were performed using the open-source federated learning simulation framework FLSim [1].
