## DFML
DFML: Dynamic Federated Meta-Learning for Rare Disease Prediction, https://scholar.google.co.kr/scholar?hl=ko&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=DFML%3A+Dynamic+Federated+Meta-Learning+for+Rare+Disease+Prediction&btnG=

- Inspired by the framework (original federated meta-learning) in [12] described above, we utilize DFML to pre-dict rare diseases and apply two additional techniques to bolster its performance. We propose a novel dynamic weight-based fusion strategy and an inaccuracy-focused mechanism based on federated meta-learning for rare dis-ease prediction.

- Some researchers use federated meta-learn-ing for personalized research [31], [32], [33], unlike feder-ated learning which focuses on the common output of all users.
