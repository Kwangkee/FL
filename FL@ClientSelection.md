  >Our algorithm CBE3 is based on the federal learning framework [Flsim](https://github.com/Kwangkee/FL/blob/main/FL%40Meta.md#federated-learning-simulator-flsim).
  
  >In this paper, we propose the contribution-based selection algorithm (Contribution-Based Exponential-weight algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation, CBE3), which dynamically updates the selection weights according to the impact of clients' data. As a novel component of CBE3, a scaling factor, which helps maintain a good balance between global model accuracy and convergence speed, is proposed to improve the algorithm's adaptability.  
  >Empirically, extensive experiments conducted on Non-Independent Identically Distributed data demonstrate the superior performance of CBE3—with up to 10% accuracy improvement compared with K-Center and Greedy and up to 100% faster convergence compared with the Random algorithm.
