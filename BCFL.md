## RL-FL-BC
RL-Based Federated Learning Framework Over Blockchain (RL-FL-BC), https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10034683

To this end, the contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
• We propose and implement an Ethereum private Blockchain to share among participants the machine learning model parameters generated from data centers, in order to facilitate the trust between data owners and preserve participant privacy,
• We design and implement a protocol for the decentralization of the machine learning model aggregations through Blockchain,
• We propose an RL-based algorithm to address the tradeoff between transaction cost, learning information age, and data skewness, i.e., non-iid,
• We develop a complete framework in a containerized environment and conduct a comprehensive comparative study to compare our solution with baselines techniques.
