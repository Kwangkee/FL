In this paper, we present CrowdFL, a platform to facilitate the crowdsourcing of FL model training. It coordinates client selection, model training, and reputation management, which are essential steps for the FL crowdsourcing operations. By implementing model training on actual mobile devices, we demonstrate that the platform improves model performance and training efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first platform to support crowdsourcing-based FL on edge devices.

In this survey, we explore the domain of Personalized FL (PFL) to address the fundamental challenges of FL on heterogeneous data, a universal characteristic inherent in all real-world datasets. We analyze the key motivations for PFL and present a unique taxonomy of PFL techniques categorized according to the key challenges and personalization strategies in PFL. We highlight their key ideas, challenges and opportunities and envision promising future trajectories of research towards new PFL architectural design, realistic PFL benchmarking, and trustworthy PFL approaches.

However, the general FL approach faces several fundamental challenges: 
- poor convergence on highly heterogeneous data, and 
- lack of solution personalization.  

These issues deteriorate the performance of the global FL model on individual clients in the presence of heterogeneous local data distributions, and may even disincentivize affected clients from joining the FL process. Compared to traditional FL, PFL research seeks to address these two challenges.

Four categories of PFL approaches: 
>1) data-based, 
>2) model-based 
>3) architecture-based, 
>4) similarity-based.

Strategy I: Global Model Personalization. Based on our proposed taxonomy, they are divided into Databased Approaches and Model-based Approaches as follows.
