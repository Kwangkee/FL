>In this work, for the first time, we test well-known FL algorithms proposed by the machine learning community on three medical datasets in order to evaluate their utility in terms of both performance and monetary cost. Specifically, we select basic FL algorithms as well as those designed for heterogeneous data distributions among different clients (i.e., hospitals). 

>We test all algorithms on the three representative real-world medical datasets with different modalities involving structured (i.e., tabular), visual, and signal data as follows:  
>• Longitudinal electronic health records (eICU) [35] collected from multiple hospitals in the US for six clinical prediction tasks such as mortality prediction and length-of-stay prediction;  
>• Medical images, specifically skin images collected by five institutions from multiple countries for diagnosing multiple skin cancer types;  
>• Electrocardiogram signals collected from five institutions from multiple countries, for diagnosing diverse heart conditions.

Federated Learning emerged as a distributed learning paradigm that takes into account several practical challenges, and differentiates itself from traditional distributed learning settings, as noted by Google [20], by addressing four main themes: 
- statistical heterogeneity of data across nodes, 
- data imbalance across nodes, 
- limited communication in the distributed network (e.g., loss of synchronization, variability of communication capabilities), 
- and the possibility of a large number of nodes relative to the amounts of data.
