>-	October 27, 2022 - A research team from the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) Swanson School of Engineering has been awarded a $1.7 million National Institutes of Health grant to develop a federated learning (FL)-based approach to achieve fairness in artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted medical screening tools.

>-	Unlike existing frameworks, this framework would rely on **unsupervised learning with data coming from a variety of smartphone models and other devices**, allowing more people to participate in the study. The framework would also have to consider the fairness of different machine learning models. The team will develop a machine learning framework that will automatically search existing learning models and use the best architectures for datasets with diverse data.

>-	In the first in-FL stage, clients with different skin types are trained in a federated learning process to construct a global model for all skin types. An automatic **weight aggregator is used in this process to assign higher weights to the client with higher loss**, and the intensity of the aggregator is determined by the level of difference between losses. 
>-	In the latter post-FL stage, **each client fine-tune its personalized model based on the global model in the in-FL stage**. To achieve better fairness, models from different epochs are selected for each client to …

>-	To address the problem, we propose a **metalearning-based personalization** method to generate the personalized neural network for each patient to conduct patient-specific detection. 
>-	Specifically, the proposed metalearning method leverages a novel patientwise training tasks formatting strategy to train the neural network that ends up with a well-generalized model initialization containing across-patient knowledge. The well-generalized model initialization would then be utilized to perform a quick adaptation to the specific patient’s data domain. 
>-	In this way, **a new patient could be immediately assigned with a personalized neural network using limited labeled data**.
