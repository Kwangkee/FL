  >It is clear that SCs designed for blockchain-based AI tasks have different functionalities than conventional SCs designed for business logic, which may lead to other characteristics and require a separate study. To make a distinction, this paper names this special type of SCs designed for blockchain-based AI tasks as Intelligent Contracts (ICs). Although ICs show a bright future, their current attempts are independent and fragmented, lacking systematic analysis. As a result, it remains unclear how to construct ICs from SCs, what their characteristics are, and how their applications contribute to AI-driven blockchain intelligence.

  >This makes SmartFL enjoy a much lower demand for on-server proxy data, better generalization, and higher aggregation eff iciency. With an optimized global model, SmartFL successfully boosts performance under either or both challenging conditions. We also establish theoretical guarantees on the convergence and generalization of SmartFL.

  >It is worth mentioning that our setup is practical, which assumes the service provider itself collects a small clean labelled proxy dataset (around a hundred samples by default).

## FedFOR
FedFOR: Stateless Heterogeneous Federated Learning with First-Order Regularization, https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10537  

We derive a first-order gradient regularization to penalize inconsistent local updates due to local data heterogeneity. Specifically, to mitigate weight divergence, we introduce a first-order approximation of the global data distribution into local objectives, which intuitively penalizes updates in the opposite direction of the global update. The end result is a stateless FL algorithm that achieves 1) significantly faster convergence (i.e., fewer communication rounds) and 2) higher overall converged performance than SOTA methods under non-IID data distribution. Importantly, our approach does not impose unrealistic limits on the client size, enabling learning from a large number of clients as is typical in most FL applications.

Our code will be released at https://github.com/GT-RIPL/FedFOR.

Most FL algorithms can be categorized under innovation to one of the components. 
- **ServerOpt** methods improve convergence by adding server-side momentum or adaptive optimizers. FedAvgM (Hsu, Qi, and Brown 2019) and SlowMo (Wang et al. 2019) simulates imbalanced data distribution, which is one form of data heterogeneity, and proposes to use server side momentum to improve convergence. FedAdagrad/FedYogi/FedAdam (Reddi et al. 2020) extends FedAvg by including several adaptive optimizers on the server-side to combat data heterogeneity.  
- **ClientOpt** methods add client-side regularization to reduce the effects of data heterogeneity. FedProx (Li et al. 2020) proposes to add a proximal term (L2 regularization) to limit the impact of non-IID data. FedCurv (Shoham et al. 2019) adapts a second-order gradient regularization method, EWC (Kirkpatrick et al. 2017), from continual learning to FL. Recent works, FedPD (Zhang et al. 2020) and FedDyn (Acar et al. 2021) improve convergence on non-IID data by including a first-order regularization term, which seeks consensus among clients. ClientOpt is investigated more heavily than ServerOpt because poor performance due to data heterogeneity is a direct result of local optimization. Furthermore, ClientOpt is more difficult to design because of the stateless requirement for FL when the number of clients is large. For example, FedPD and FedDyn are stateful algorithms and can be difficult to apply to large-scale, real-world FL settings. 

In this paper, we focus on the ClientOpt component to improve convergence under non-IID data distribution and compare analytically and empirically to all ClientOpt methods mentioned in this section.
